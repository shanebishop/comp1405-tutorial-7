Programs I wrote for tutorial 7 of my Introduction to Computer Science I course

The program constructing lists of predefined length generates a list with a length provided by the user, where each element of the list is preset to -1. The program then iterates throught the list, asking the user what value they would like to replace each element with.

The program constructing lists of arbitrary length allows the user to build a list by appending new values to the list, remove the last element in the list, or exit the program.

The program calculations applied to lists part 1 reuses the code from the previous two exercises, with two added functions - the first function checks to see if every element of the list is a number and the second function returns either the sum of all the values in the list (if every element of the list is a number) or a value of zero (if one or more elements of the list was not a number).

The program calculations applied to lists part 2 reuses the code from the first two exercises. It also computes the sum of all even and odd numbers in a list and concatenates all of the nonnumeric elements of a list.
